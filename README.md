READ ME

A special thanks to Andrew Dresner, for all that he has done for me, throughout this robot. Also, I would like to thank him for allowing me to use his ArbotixPro.h & ArbotixPro.cpp files as templates for my own code,  while I work on creating code that is 100% mine. When there is something I dont understand, Andrew is the kind of guy who would send me a link to Google's homepage (www.google.com) and tell me to slow down, and take the time to look things up. He has reminded me to keep my sanity, and stops me when he sees that I am trying to get too far ahead of myself. Therefore, I feel that a 'thank you' of this length is appropriate.
